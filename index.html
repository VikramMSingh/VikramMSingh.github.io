<p>
          Hello and welcome to my page! I'm Vikram, born and raised in Mumbai. Moved to Cleveland in 2015 for my graduate degree at Case Western Reserve University.
          I disagree with Joakim Noah and will say that Cleveland is a really nice city, not as happening as Mumbai but I enjoy it here.
          
          I have a Bachelors of Technology in Civil Engineering and a Masters in Engineering and Management. My work experience is quite varied.
          My first experience was as an Intern Site Engineer for Supreme Infrastructures. Our project was to construct a data center for Vodafone, that is operational during natural or man-made disasters.
          We had to achieve this goal without minimal environmental impact as the goal was to achieve IGBC (Indian Green Building Council) Gold status.

<a id="goals" class="anchor" href="#goals" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What & Why</h3>
<p>My goal is to help people, by creating simple products to reduce their workload.</p>
<p>I have created a simple trading algorithm, but do not use it for trading. I only use it to calculate probablity of loss or profit based on 10 year historical data. I am currently working on creating a web based rental management software.</p>
